## Overview

the => allows you to define methods more concisely, usually when they have a single expression.

## Purpose

really it's just a faster way to write the...

{

}

...container of a method and just looks cleaner especially for all of the GetEdge() methods I've been doing

## Syntax

```
public int GetLeftEdge() => _x;
```

## Discussion

Idk if I have much to say, it's just cleaner than writing the whole body of the function for smaller repeatable functions.
